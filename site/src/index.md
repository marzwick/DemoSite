# Scientific Teaching Course

Welcome to the Scientific Teaching Course! We (the authors) are a team of STEM educators, scholars, and change agents, with decades of collective experience in the classroom and promoting systemic change in higher education.

We represent many types of colleges, universities, disciplines, and student demographics, as well as our own backgrounds and perspectives. Though we do not represent every institution type, class size, or demographic, we think that the variety in our perspectives and experiences augments the scholarship on which this course is based.

Importantly, we hope that you, as a STEM instructor, find yourself inspired by these pages to rethink your students’ scientific learning experiences and retool how you craft those experiences!

## History of the Course

Scientific teaching content, before it was named, began as *Biology Brought to Life*, a student research guide for *Plants, Parasites, and People*, a biology course for first-year, non-science-major undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Published in 1995 by Dr. Jo Handelsman and colleagues, the course also included a revolutionary companion guide for teaching assistants that described how to use active and cooperative learning approaches with the evidence to back up why.

In the early 2000s, these materials grew to serve a broader audience outside the course and drew from the scholarship of teaching and learning, discipline-based education research, action research, evidence-based instructional practices, teaching-as-research, and others. The content was, however, unique in its focus on scientific disciplines and higher education. As content was added, it became a set of hole-punched pages gathered in a three-ring binder and many hand-written tabs.

Each binder contained a fresh, new perspective on STEM teaching and learning because it leveraged the best educational approaches known at the time. It included a synthesis of the current state of recommended STEM education practices with content pulled from higher education, K-12 literature, and curriculum and instruction research, along with practical examples and tools for teaching. The scientific teaching binders served as the textbook for graduate student courses taught through the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Wisconsin Program for Scientific Teaching, and eventually, starting in 2004, for the National Academies Summer Institute on Undergraduate Education in Biology.

Held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for many years, both programs modeled scientific teaching through their interactive formats, active learning approaches, and cooperative group projects. Each iteration of these programs informed an evolution of the scientific teaching body of knowledge. For example, backward design approaches, educational taxonomies, facilitator training content, and institutional transformation tips were added as a direct result of what we and our colleagues learned each time we led one of these programs.

In 2004, Dr. Handelsman and colleagues published the first eponymous article about scientific teaching in *Science* magazine, which both coined the term and served as a call to arms to reform how science was taught in higher education [handelsman_scientific_2004](@cite). Soon after, in the winter of 2006, Scientific Teaching was first printed as a book by Roberts & Co., and moved to W.H. Freeman and Co. in 2007, where it could be bundled and freely distributed with STEM textbooks to reach more instructors [handelsman_scientific_2007](@cite).

The published book swiftly became the foundation for two decades of graduate programs and national, regional, and local institutes held around the world. The book and its programs were cited as exemplary approaches to college STEM education reform in reports such as *Vision and Change* and *Engage to Excel*, eventually growing to a five-volume series. Over XX,000 copies have been printed and distributed, and we estimate more than XX,000 instructors use the content or its derivatives. 

While *Scientific Teaching* was revolutionary at its first printing and many of its tenets and recommended practices have stood the test of time, nearly two decades have passed.

New interventions and research findings have blossomed in many fields – education research, social science, education psychology, inclusive learning, online and hybrid learning, discipline-based education research, and more – rendering many of the perspectives, practices, and philosophies from the first edition Scientific Teaching incomplete or outdated.

Therefore, we assembled a diverse team of instructors with the expertise and experience to do again what scientific teaching does best: synthesize the current state of knowledge while providing practical guidance, examples, and tools. However, this version is (obviously) not a book. Instead, it draws on new learning principles, is framed as an interactive, and is a self-guided course that models scientific teaching practices. 

Our goal is that the digital *Scientific Teaching Course* can position you and your colleagues to enact relevant and necessary STEM education improvements through the mid-21st century. We hope that your courses taught using these principles inspire a generation of college students – especially those from groups historically excluded from STEM – to see themselves as scientists and be equipped to address the scientific challenges that lie ahead.

## Structure of the Course

The course is modular and designed to be self-paced.

- Part One provides an overview of scientific teaching and a call to action.
- Part Two builds on that foundation, providing opportunities to engage with the content, practice with the tools, self-assess, reflect, and apply to your own teaching.
- Part Three provides tools to synthesize what you learned and identify areas for further development.

## FAQ

### Where do I begin?

Before you begin, we recommend you select one of your STEM courses to revise or build anew as you proceed through the modules. Gather any materials you might want to work on during the Scientific Teaching Course, such as syllabus, learning objectives, lecture materials, assignments or assessments, lab experiments, or instructor guides. It’s ok if you are starting from scratch!

```@raw html
<!-- 
The Scientific Teaching Course begins and ends with a questionnaire that will gauge your progress and track your outcomes. After completing a baseline questionnaire, the modules will open to you. We recommend starting with the Scientific Teaching module, then proceeding through the rest of the modules in this order: Course Design, Learning Experiences, then Scientific Teaching Revisited. Each module builds on the content from the previous modules and is self-contained with multimedia components, interactive exercises, and self-assessment quizzes. [However, you may begin with any module?] The course is designed so that you can work on developing a new course or redesigning an existing course while you are completing it.

### What products will I create during the Scientific Teaching Course?

After the course, you will have generated: 

- A partially completed course design template and syllabus
- A set of your own reflective responses to question prompts
- A plan for ongoing improvements 

Specifically, you will have worked on several components of your STEM course, including the overall design; syllabus, course schedule, and welcome materials; learning objectives, activities, and assessments; and any supporting materials such as lecture notes or exam questions. Each of these components will incorporate evidence-based practices that support inclusive learning.

During the modules, we recommend that you practice using each scientific teaching tool on small parts of your course and in the provided templates. And throughout, the modules will prompt you to leave yourself detailed notes about when and how you plan to finish creating the course materials, when you plan to implement them, and how you will approach iterative revisions over time. To make space for these new tools, you may have to reconsider the nature and amount of content your students are accountable for learning.

### What will I learn during the Scientific Teaching Course?

The learning objectives for the course as a whole are:

- Describe the tenets of scientific teaching 
- Explain how the tenets work together to promote STEM learning and diversity in STEM
- Apply the tenets to your own teaching and course(s) 

For module-specific objectives, refer to the learning objectives embedded in each module.

### How long will it take?

We estimate each module will take approximately one hour to complete. This includes time to reflect on your teaching, consider new approaches, and build or re-work small pieces of your course in the workbook. We have curated resources to make your time in the modules efficient and worthwhile.

However, the extent to which you work on each component and the degree of completion is entirely up to you and will affect the amount of time you spend.

### What data will be collected?

The pre- and post-surveys collect (1) information about you, your students, your course(s), and your institution; and (2) your responses to several questions about your teaching perspective and practice.

### How will the data be used?

Data will be used to guide course improvements. It may be used for other purposes, such as reporting, publishing, demonstrating the effectiveness of the course, or promoting the course.

### How will my data be protected? 

We will only report data anonymously and/or in aggregate, with care not to report data from very small subsets of demographic groups where certain individuals might be identified. Quotes may be used but, unless explicit permission is given, they will remain anonymous and identifying data (e.g., institution or name) will be removed. Only the PIs, project team, and technical support at Codon Learning will have access to identifiable data. Data will be saved in a secure, password-protected location such as Box or OneDrive. Data protection will follow practices outlined by the University of Colorado, Boulder institutional review board guidelines (IRB protocol 22-0257). 

### What certification will I receive for completion?

When you complete all course modules and the pre- and post-surveys, you will receive a certificate of completion `TODO digital badge?`.

### Can I join a cohort to discuss the course content further?

Yes. If you are interested in joining a community of practice around the *Scientific Teaching Course*, `TODO insert sign-up mechanism here`.

### Will there be any follow up after the course?

We anticipate creating a mechanism for instructors to share their course materials, experiences, and data as they develop over the years. `TODO this is under construction.`
