    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    `TODO: write these`

Learning is the acquisition and integration of new information that leads to a change in behavior.

!!! note ""

    Think of a concept that is challenging for students to learn. 

    - Why do you think it is challenging?
    - What may help or hinder student learning in your discipline?
    - In general, under what conditions do you learn best?
    - Does your personal view of learning affect how you teach?

**Constructing Knowledge**

![slide10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/slide10.png)

- Everyone has views about how the world works. Views are based on prior knowledge and experiences. The views could be inaccurate, insufficient, or inappropriate.

- New information challenges these views. Consistent information validates the views, while inconsistent information requires the difference to be reconciled and explained.

- During reconciliation, new neural networks form. [What else cognitively?]

- New neural networks [and cognitive psychology] lead to changes in behavior or affect.

- Repetition, extended application, targeted practice, and assessment with feedback contribute to retention. [Where does metacognition go?]

### Seven Principles for Learning

!!! compat ""
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    `TODO: write these`

This brings us to a set of research-based principles that are important for learning (Ambrose et al., 2010). 
1. Prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.
2. How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.
3. Expertise requires skills, practice, and application.
4. Motivation determines, directs, and sustains what students do to learn.
5. Goal-directed practice + targeted feedback enhances the quality of learning.
6. Students’ level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate to impact learning.
7. To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.

### The Role of Prior Knowledge in Learning

!!! compat ""
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    `TODO: write these`

Let’s start with prior knowledge. We often think of prior knowledge as “right” and “wrong.” We say that students either get it, or they don’t. This thinking leads us to assume that students hold misconceptions that need to be “corrected” or “replaced” with a right answer. We become frustrated when they get answers wrong that we lectured about or they read in the textbook.

However, prior knowledge is complex. Each student brings a set of knowledge, beliefs, experiences, and world views to every learning experience. In the 2010 book, How Learning Works: Seven research-based principles for smart teaching, Susan Ambrose et al., state: 
- Students connect what they learn to what they already know, interpreting incoming information, and even sensory perception, through the lens of their existing knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions (Vygotsky, 1978; NRC 2000)…. students must connect new knowledge to previous knowledge in order to learn (Bransford & Johnson, 1972; Resnick, 1983)…. However the extent to which students are able to draw on prior knowledge to effectively construct new knowledge depends on the nature of their prior knowledge, as well as the instructor’s ability to harness it. 

**Contending with Prior Knowledge**

<u>Activating prior knowledge:</u>

Prior knowledge must be activated for learning to occur. Ambrose et al., again:

- When students connect what they are learning to accurate and relevant prior knowledge, they learn and retain more. In essence, new knowledge “sticks” better when it has prior knowledge to stick to.

But students don’t always bring their knowledge or connect it to the learning experience at hand.


<u>Show me the evidence:</u>

People with more knowledge of soccer recalled more scores from different soccer matches than people with less soccer knowledge (Morris et al., 1981). 

When presented with new facts about individuals, college students were able to learn and retain those facts twice as often if the individuals were familiar when compared to unfamiliar individuals (Kole and Healy, 2007).

**Prior Knowledge… that is not quite “right”**

What if the student’s prior knowledge is inaccurate, or their understanding is only partly correct? Understanding the types of prior knowledge can help us create better learning environments.

<u>Accurate but insufficient prior knowledge</u>  

- Students possess some relevant knowledge, but it is not sufficient to support subsequent learning or a desired level of performance. The knowledge can be declarative (facts and concepts) or procedural (knowing when or how to apply procedures, methods, or theories). 
    - **Example:**
    Students know which statistical test to perform (declarative) but cannot apply it (procedural). Students may be able to apply formulas to data analysis (procedural) but not be able to explain their logic (declarative).

<u>Inappropriate prior knowledge</u> 

- Students draw on prior knowledge that is not appropriate for the learning context. It is not necessarily inaccurate – it is merely used inaccurately.
    - **Example:**
    Students’ everyday associations with the terms positive and negative skew their understanding of science concepts, such as negative controls in an experiment, or negative reinforcement in psychology.

<u>Inaccurate prior knowledge</u> 

- Information that is objectively wrong. This includes incorrect facts, as well as flawed ideas, beliefs, models, or theories.
    - **Example:**
    Students believe that Pluto is a planet or that the heart oxygenates the blood.


!!! note ""
    **Prior Knowledge and Misconceptions**

    How can we con tend with all these types of prior knowledge? Be clear in the knowledge requirements for different tasks. Do not assume because students know the facts that they know how to apply them, and vice versa. Assess both the amount and nature of prior knowledge and design instruction accordingly. 
    
    *Now you try!* Below is an example designed to elicit prior knowledge and misconceptions about antibiotic resistance and evolution. 

    **Student Activities:**

    >Part 1.

    View A Tiny World video (3 min 11 sec).
    Identify three misconceptions stated by the interviewees and explain what is wrong with them.

    >Part 2.

    Explain why each statement is incorrect.
    “I have a really bad cold.  I should go the doctor to get a prescription for antibiotics.”
    “Antibiotics are getting weaker.”
    “People are becoming immune to antibiotics.”
    “The bacteria mutated to become resistant to the antibiotic.”

    **Engagement Prompts: Review the Student Activities.**

    - How do these activities activate prior knowledge?
    - What type of prior knowledge would these activities detect?
        - Accurate but insufficient - declarative
        - Accurate but insufficient - procedural
        - Inappropriate
        - Inaccurate
    - How would you characterize the statements in Part 2?
        - Accurate but insufficient - declarative
        - Accurate but insufficient - procedural
        - Inappropriate
        - Inaccurate
    - What would you teach next in this course?

**Research-Based Strategies for Contending with Prior Knowledge**

Gauge the extent and nature of students’ prior knowledge:

- Administer diagnostic assessments
- Have students assess their own prior knowledge
- Use brainstorming to reveal prior knowledge
- Assign a concept map activity
- Look for patterns of error in student work
- Talk to a colleague

Activate accurate prior knowledge: 

- Use exercises to generate students’ prior knowledge (e.g., brainstorm, concept map)
- Explicitly link new material to knowledge from previous courses or your course
- Use analogies and examples that connect to everyday knowledge
- Ask students to reason on the basis of relevant prior knowledge

Address insufficient prior knowledge:

- Identify the prior knowledge you expect students to have
- Remediate insufficient prerequisite knowledge

Help students recognize inappropriate prior knowledge: 

- Highlight conditions of applicability
- Provide heuristics to help students avoid inappropriate application of knowledge 
- Explicitly identify discipline-specific conventions
- Show where analogies break down

Correct inaccurate knowledge:

- Ask students to make and test predictions
- Ask students to justify their reasoning
- Provide multiple opportunities for students to use accurate knowledge
- Allow sufficient time

**A Note about Misconceptions**

Misconceptions are a type of inaccurate prior knowledge that are especially resistant to correction. Misconceptions are models or theories that are deeply embedded in students’ thinking. For example, the notion that blind people have more sensitive hearing than sighted folks, and stereotypes about groups of people fall into this category. Misconceptions persist despite direct instructional interventions.

Misconceptions are difficult to refute for a number of reasons:

- They have been reinforced over time and across multiple contexts
- Because they often include accurate–as well as inaccurate– elements, students may not recognize their flaws.
- They allow for successful explanations and predictions in a number of everyday circumstances. For example, although stereotypes are dangerous simplifications, they are difficult to change in part because they fit aspects of our perceived reality and serve an adaptive human need to generalize and categorize (Allport 1952; Brewer 1988; Fiske & Taylor, 1991). 

**What to do?** Guide students through a process of conceptual change over time, persistently creating opportunities to activate students’ awareness and motivation to apply reason over stereotypes. Creatively combine strategies from the STC. It takes time, patience, and creativity.

## The Biology of Learning

!!! compat ""
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    `TODO: write these`

- A human brain comprises 1011 neurons. 
- Each neuron is capable of thousands of connections.
- Average brain has 1015 neural connections.
- Networks are unique to each person, and they can change.
- More stimulus leads to more complex neural networks.

**Implications for Learning**

Learning must:

- Account for and contend with existing neural networks
- Provide opportunity to challenge those networks and construct new networks.

Neurons communicate with each other to drive everything we do, including how we learn. Learning requires adapting existing neural processes to orchestrate new pathways and new behaviors. Constructing knowledge involves making new neuronal connections and/or enhancing connections that exist.

At a cellular and molecular level, the changing nature, or plasticity, of neuronal connections can lead to long-lasting changes in synaptic connections, neurotransmitter release, receptor number and binding properties (Basett et al, 2017). The consequences of these changes for humans are new behaviors and an ability to use new knowledge. The formation of long-lasting connections, and the storage of this information are what we think of as memory. 

Many things contribute to learning, including one’s prior experiences, stress, situational factors, and motivation. Each of these can create different conditions that either favor learning in general, or favor learning a particular aspect of a situation (for example, a familiar smell from childhood can bring back specific memories) (Gold and Korol, 2017). Significant learning experiences commonly involve an important event or relationship to real events, a level of interest or value in the experience, and an opportunity to apply and integrate new knowledge (Fink 2013).

## Factors that Affect Learning

!!! compat ""
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    `TODO: write these`

Students are not necessarily well-informed about best learning practices. They often engage in whatever strategies have previously worked without being consciously aware of whether they are effective. Their choices are also affected by their interest in a topic, their motivation, and how much time they have to devote to learning something. 

**Memory and Retrieval**

The strength of a memory represents how associated the memory is with related knowledge and skills. A brain region called the hippocampus is involved in creating and storing memories. How well you can retrieve a memory depends on how accessible that information is, which can be influenced by how recently you thought about the information as well as other situational cues. Sometimes easily retrieved information is also easily forgotten, because it has not been consolidated and stored (Bjork and Bjork 2011)

**Developing Conceptual Frameworks**  

`Check if should be an activity or not`

An expert not only understands many concepts, but can relate them to each other, transfer principles across concepts, and easily add new knowledge to their framework. Novice are still acquiring and connecting information, and as a result, need guidance and practice in constructing their own frameworks. Experts have a conceptual framework that they use to identify concepts or patterns in various contexts so that they can transfer/apply their understanding to solve problems in novel contexts

![slide31](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/slide31.png)

!!! note ""
    Provide the following information from the Chi paper, and write a question that lets the participant pretend to be a novice student in physics, thinking about how to organize problems. Experts organize by conceptual principles and students organize by surface features (Chi, Feltovich, and Glaser (1981) Cognitive Science 5: 121-152).

    ![slide32](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/slide32.png)

    ---

    Show two groupings, and have the participants identify which one is likely the expert grouping vs. the novice. Follow up question: describe what features the experts used to organize vs. what the novices used.

    Experts: all use the underlying concept
    - “Conservation of energy.”
    - “Work-energy theorem. They are all straight-forward problems.”
    - “These can be done from energy considerations. Either you should know the principle of conservation of energy, or work is lost somewhere.”

    Novices: use the pictorial representation (surface features) without understanding the underlying concepts are different
    - “These deal with blocks on an incline plane.”
    - “Inclined plane problems, coefficient of friction.”
    - “Blocks on inclined planes with angles."

!!! note ""
    **Context and Expertise**

    We use the context of our prior experiences and knowledge to help us solve problems. Consider this study:

    Researchers showed arrangements of chessboards to different kinds of participants and gave them ~ 30 sec to memorize the board. They were then asked to fill in a blank chess board from memory. Using the graphs shown below that summarize the findings, what can you conclude?

    ---

    ![slide33](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/slide33.png)

    **Sample answer to be included in the feedback box:**

    Master chess players performed as badly as novices when the chessboard pieces were totally random. But when it was a real chess board, the master chess players easily remembered far more pieces than the novice. That is because they had the CONTEXT of the chess board and the game they were intimately familiar with to help them remember (Chase and Simon, 1973).  

!!! note ""
    **Expertise: Practice and reflection are both essential**

    One of the most valuable learning strategies is to practice retrieving information and then using it in a novel situation (Karpike & Roediger 2006). Too often, both instructors and students stop at the level of remembering a fact or understanding a concept at a basic level. Testing provides better feedback to a student than the more passive strategies of re-reading or re-watching. 

    To make the most of practice, students also need to reflect on their learning and figure out what they do and don’t know--i.e. Regulate.
