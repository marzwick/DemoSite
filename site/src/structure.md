## A Framework for Course Structure 

By adopting the principles of Universal Design, an instructor can build an inclusive course from the outset.

**Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** is a *framework for designing and delivering flexible, inclusive, and accessible learning experiences that can be customized to meet the needs of all learners*, regardless of their abilities, backgrounds, or learning preferences (CAST, 2018). It is rooted in the principles of **Universal Design**, which is an approach to creating products environments, and experiences that are **usable by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation or specialized design**. UDL is based on the idea that learning should be engaging, relevant, and responsive to individual needs. Importantly, **UDL aims to change thedesign of the environment rather than to change the learner.**

As we saw previously, **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** *places accessibility at the forefront and leverages various AJEDI principles* for improving teaching and learning for all students. To help implement UDL in the classroom, the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) developed the **UDL Guidelines** (CAST, 2018). These are *a set of principles and strategies that aim to provide equal and inclusive access to learning for all students*, including those with disabilities or diverse learning styles. The guidelines provide specific recommendations for creating flexible and engaging learning environments and materials that can be customized to meet the diverse needs and preferences of all students.

The UDL Guidelines encompass **three key principles:** providing multiple means of (1) Engagement, (2) Representation, and (3) Action and Expression.

![slide10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs10.jpeg)

**UDL Guidelines: Multiple Means of Representation**  

In this submodule, we will be focusing on the principle of providing **multiple means of Representation.** This principle outlines strategies for creating course materials that provide options for perception, language and symbols, and comprehension.
- **Perception:** *Present information in a variety of formats*, such as visual, auditory, and tactile. Instructors can use this principle to ensure that textbooks, videos, lectures, and other course materials are accessible to all students, including those with disabilities or those who process information differently. By incorporating visual aids, videos, diagrams, and other interactive media, instructors provide multiple ways of representing important information and allow students to choose the means that work best for them.

- **Language & Symbols:** *Use clear, concise, and accessible language and symbols and avoid language or symbols that may be exclusive, biased, or offensive.* This guideline aims to promote understanding and reduce barriers to learning by selecting language and symbols that are familiar and meaningful to all learners. This can be achieved by providing captioning, transcripts, and audio descriptions for multimedia content, incorporating pictures or symbols to represent concepts, and avoiding jargon or complex language whenever possible, and providing alternative means of representation for students with different cultural and linguistic
backgrounds.

- **Comprehension:** *Incorporate a variety of instructional techniques to ensure that students can access, process, and assimilate new information and knowledge.* Instructors need to provide supports and scaffold curriculum to help students comprehend the material. This can include activating or providing prior knowledge; providing explicit cues or prompts to emphasize key elements, concepts, and features; embedding scaffolds and feedback to organize and process information; and incorporating opportunities for students to apply their knowledge to new contexts.

For more information on the other two principles, visit the [CAST UDL website](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/).

## Course Structure in Practice

**Communicating course structure to students**

<u> First day of class</u> 

Instructors might consider collaborating with various colleagues or resources as they design their course to meet UDL guidelines. For example, instructors could consult with:

- Staff at the university's center for teaching and learning
- Staff at the university's disability services office Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) specialists
- Teaching assistants
- Technology specialists

!!! note "Activity"

    **Evaluate the way this instructor uses UDL principles on their first day of class.**
    
    Review the following slides from an introductory biology class for nonmajors (asynchronous and online). What elements from the UDL Guidelines are present? Additionally, how could the slides be improved?

    `TODO: add slides`

<u> Learner-Centered Syllabi</u> 

The syllabus offers one of the first opportunities for instructors to communicate with their students about the course and begin building an inclusive learning environment. The **conventional syllabus** is *content-focused*, providing a brief overview of the course subject matter followed by a weekly outline of topics to be covered, and a list of assignments and course activities with relative grading weights and due dates.

A **learner-centered syllabus** also provides basic course information, but **it shifts the emphasis** from what the instructor will cover in the course *to what learning outcomes students will achieve by the end of the course* (Johnson, 2006). It explains how learning will be assessed and offers information and tools to promote student learning and intellectual development in an inclusive environment. It establishes the responsibilities of the instructor(s) and students for achieving course goals. In short, the learner-centered syllabus "becomes an invitation to share responsibility for successful learning" (O'Brien et al., 2008, p. 22).

In his book, "What the Best College Teachers Do," Ken Bain (2004) describes three parts of what he calls "the promising syllabus":

1. **Highlight the promises or opportunities.**

    - What kinds of questions
    - will the course help students answer?
    - What kind of intellectual, physical, emotional, or social abilities will it help them develop?
    - Why is the course relevant?

2. **Explain what students will do to meet those promises.**

    - What are the learning activities (e.g., activities, assignments, readings) that will be used in the course?
    - How will they learn from the course resources, the instructional team, and each other?
    - Give students a sense of agency in their education

3. **Discuss how students will engage in the learning process.**

    - How will the instructor and students best "understand the nature and progress of their learning?"
    - How will learning be evaluated?
    - How will all students feel included in the learning process and welcome as scientists?

**Learner-Centered Syllabus Example**

`TODO: add link`

Click on this link to view a syllabus from Dr. Cara Gormally for an asynchronous introductory biology class for non-majors (bilingual-American Sign Language & English). Take note of what the syllabus contains. A sample of text from Dr. Gormally's syllabus is provided below (page 2, following the course description).

--

**What we'll actually do**

- You're likely taking this class because it's required for your major.
- My goal: make this class actually useful to your life.
- Together, we'll make this class meaningful for ourselves. How will we do that?
- We'll learn biology relevant to our lives: when a person is most likely to get pregnant; how Covid-19 vaccines work; why we have skin color; how antidepressants work; what we can do to slow climate change; and why we should limit plastic use.
- There's no textbook; we'll read and watch high quality enjoyable articles and videos.
- We'll learn how to answer questions we have related to biology, for example about health or the environment.
- I hope you're excited about our class--I am so excited to get to know you all and do this work together! This work feels real and important to me. I hope you think so, too.

**Diversity: it makes our class better**

- **Build community through discussion:** Though we won't meet face-to-face, we'll learn about each other and build a community through our discussions.
- **Diversity strengthens us:** The diversity that we all bring to this class is a resource, strength and benefit to our class. I'm committed to anti-racism and I believe Black Lives Matter. Everyone belongs here in my classroom if you want to be here. In this class, we'll use materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, national origin, ethnicity, race, culture, etc. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.
- **You make our class what it is.** Our class will be awesome because of the diversity of perspectives, thoughts, and experiences that we will share through our work. Who you are, what you bring to our class, your perspective--it's important.

!!! note "Activity"
    **Learner-Centered Syllabus**

    Now that you've seen a learner-centered syllabus, reflect on your own syllabus. (If you do not have one, think about a traditional syllabus or one from a course you've taken.) Think about the elements in a learner-centered syllabus and the components of your syllabus.

    What are two things you could change in your syllabus to make it more learner-centered? You can use these prompts to help you re-imagine your syllabus:
    - What are the promises or opportunities presented by the instructor?
    - What activities will students do in order to meet those promises?
    - How will students track progress of their learning (i.e., how will learning be evaluated)?

**Structuring for Accessibility**

<u>What is Accessibility?</u>

Providing access to resources is **fundamental to addressing inequities**, because it ensures that course structures, artifacts, and the environment do not preclude anyone from learning. However, *the mere existence of a resource* **does not by itself lead to equitable and inclusive outcomes.**

**Accessibility** refers to the *design and creation of products, devices, environments, and content that can be used and accessed by all people*, including those with disabilities or other impairments. The goal of accessibility is to **provide equal access and opportunities for everyone, regardless of their abilities**, so that they can participate fully in all aspects of society. This includes considerations such as physical, digital, and social accessibility.

In the context of education, accessibility refers to the practice of creating learning environments, resources, and technologies that allow all students to access and engage with academic content and participate in learning activities.

- **Physical accessibility:** Make physical spaces and materials accessible, such as by providing wheelchair ramps, captioning videos, and offering alternative formats of textbooks. 
- **Digital accessibility:** Design digital content and technologies that are compatible with assistive technologies, such as screen readers and text-to-speech software.
- **Social accessibility:** Use inclusive language, accommodate different communication styles.

**The Need for Accessibility**

`TODO: add citations slide 24`

Students with disabilities face many challenges when seeking accommodations in higher education (Gin et al., 2020).

    **Invisible Barriers and Inequity**

    The image below shows an instructor making an announcement about office hours, and the different responses of his students. What unintentional inequities are revealed in this interaction, and how would you try to offset them? (Yee, 2016)
    ![slide25](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs25.png)

!!! note "Activity"    

    **Is it Accessible?**

    For each of the following pictures and accompanying statements, list the considerations an instructor should address to ensure all students have access to learning. Think about barriers and issues related to the physical space, learning, sensory, communication, chronic health, and mental health.

    ![slide26](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs26.png)

    ![slide27](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs27.png)

    ![slide28](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs28.png)


An accessible course design **reduces the need for accommodation, alleviates the burden and stigma** associated with students seeking accommodations, **saves time** for educators, and **diminishes the cost** associated with providing individual accommodations. Importantly, accessibility **improves educational outcomes for all learners** by making sure that educational materials and resources are available and usable by everyone, regardless of their individual needs.

Universal Design for Learning (UDL) provides a framework that guides educators to create accessible course materials and flexible and inclusive learning experiences that meet the needs of all learners, regardless of their abilities or background. Why build a course with UDL at the forefront instead of accommodating student needs as they arise? Consider this passage from Rose and colleagues (2006):

<span style="font-size:0.9em;">

>"Such an environmental view fosters solutions that **address the limitations of the learning environment** rather than the limitations of the student, while making the student less of a problem, and **more a part of diversity within the course**. The advantage of such universal solutions is that, as with such approaches in built environments, they are likely to be useful for many individuals; **built once, applied many times.**" (p. 150)

</span>

**Individuals with disabilities are highly underrepresented in STEM degree attainment and STEM employment.**

Individuals with disabilities enter postsecondary education at a slightly higher percentage in which they are represented in the general population. Additionally, individuals with disabilities enroll in STEM field majors at the same percentage as individuals without disabilities.

![slide30](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs30.png)

**The Impact of Accessibility**

Studies have shown that using UDL principles and teaching strategies **positively affect student's perception, performance, and engagement in learning.**

![slide31](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs31.png)

Structuring a course using UDL and AJEDI principles positively impacts students, increasing engagement,and empowering students. 

![slide32](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs32.png)

**Show Me the Data!**

To determine the possible impact of equity-oriented pedagogy on student learning, researchers recruited 54 undergraduate students for a treatment group and 59 students for a control. Equity- oriented pedagogy was defined as using specific components of democratic, assessment-driven, strengths-based, multimodal, and game-based pedagogies. Instructors in the treatment group applied the equity-oriented pedagogy, using student data and feedback to adjust instruction, while instructors for the control group used a standard pedagogy and no data/feedback.

The researchers found statistically **significant differences on the final assessment scores** in favor of students who were in the treatment classroom (p < .0001). Students in each group answered questions before each lesson (pre) and at the end of each lesson (post). These scores each week are shown in Figure 1. **Students in the treatment group consistently outperformed those in the control group** (Phuong et al., 2017).

**The High Structure Course Format**

Course structure refers to the organization of a course's content, activities, experiences, and assessments. The structure of a course lies on a continuum from low to high. Low structure courses have few opportunities for engagement and assessment whereas high structure courses embed multiple opportunities for engagement and frequent assessments (Beck & Roosa, 2020). Low structure courses assume that students know how to efficiently work with course materials in and outside of class. However, data suggest that many students do not implement effective study strategies nor time management skills (Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2012). High structure courses scaffold student learning with increased engagement and practice and by decoding the learning process through clear and accessible learning goals and expectations (Beck & Roosa, 2020).

![slide38](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs38.png)

    Which course looks more like yours and why?

    If you haven't taught a course yet, which course preparation resonates with your experiences as a student?
  

**The Impact of High Structure Courses**

Increasing a course's structure has many implications for student learning and their educational experience.

- **Student failure rates** were lower in a moderately structured course design and were **dramatically lower in a highly structured course design** (Freeman et al., 2011)
- A "moderate-structure" intervention **increased course performance for all student populations**, but worked **disproportionately well for black students and first-generation students**. Students also consistently reported completing the assigned readings more frequently, spending more time studying for class, and feeling an increased sense of community (Eddy & Hogan, 2014)
- Implementing a hybrid course format with high structure improved exam performance for **traditionally underrepresented students** (Gavassa et al., 2019)
- A highly structured course design improved the performance of all students in a college-level introductory biology class and **reduced the achievement gap between disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged students** (Haak et al., 2011)

**Show Me the Data!**
Freeman and colleagues measured failure rates in a major's introductory biology course, while varying the structure of the course. One instructor taught the course in 6 iterations using a low structure, moderate structure, or high structure course design (2011). The researchers found that the difference between the proportion of students predicted to fail and the actual proportion failing decreased with increasing structure. (n = 2267, *p = 0.06, **p = 0.0004).

    **Evaluate the Data Yourself**

    Eddy and Hogan (2014) used a similar study structure, comparing exam performance in traditional vs. increased structure sections of the same course. The figure below shows point estimates for exam performance (% correct) based on a regression model that included (A) race and ethnicity and (B) first-generation status.

    What conclusions can you draw from these data? (Check all that apply.)

    ![slide44](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs44.png)

    - [ ] Exam performance will likely not be affected by course structure.
    - [ ] All students are expected to perform worse on exams in high structure courses. All students are expected to perform better on exams in high structure courses.
    - [ ] Students from communities historically excluded from STEM aren't expected to show much improvement.
    - [ ] Students from communities historically excluded from STEM are expected to show greater improvements.

Remember, a high structure course has multiple opportunities for engagement and practice and makes clear the learning goals and expectations (Beck & Roosa, 2020). Eddy and Hogan provide a table that shows how adding in more graded preparatory assignments, student in-class engagement, and graded review assignments increases course design (2014).

![slide45](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marzwick/images/main/cs45.png)

Preparatory assignments are tasks or activities given to students prior to a class or lesson to help them prepare for upcoming content. Examples: reading assigned texts, watching videos, researching a topic, completing practice exercises.

Graded review assignments are tasks or assessments that evaluate students' understanding, comprehension, and recall of previously covered material. Examples: case studies, writing assignments, discussion posts, quizzes, projects.
